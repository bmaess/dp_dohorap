1.4 Choice of measurement methods

[Acquisition]
MEG: Very high sampling rate
very little spatial distortion from the head
Low signal-to-noise ratio

[Forward models]
Based on individual high-resolution anatomical data
1-layer BEM: Robust creation, good software support
Quick and semi-automated process

[Localization]
Distributed source model: models a ton of unwanted activity
-> high SNR for actual ROI
sLORETA: no overlap effect at the boundaries, high ROI specificity

[Information transfer]
Meaning of information transfer
modelling vs. model-free, linear vs. nonlinear
Transfer Entropy is suited best for highly complex, nonlinear timescale data
Potential pitfall: Volume conduction (can also come from bad localization)
TrenTOOL can correct volume conduction
