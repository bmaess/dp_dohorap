If not noted otherwise, two comma-separated values in brackets describe the upper and lower values of a 95% confidence interval.

3.1.1 Response times

A Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted to determine if individual data were normal distributed.
No subject exceeded a probability of p=1e-8 that their response times were normal distributed.
Therefore, we decided to represent individual response times by their median.

Children needed a median time of 1.91s (1.64s, 2.19s) to respond to object-relative clauses.
For subject-relative clauses, they needed 1.97s (1.69s, 2.25s).
Adults needed a median time of 1.51s (1.28, 1.73s) to respond to object-relative clauses.
For subject-relative clauses, they needed 1.60s (1.37s, 1.82s).

A Shapiro-Wilk test was then conducted to determine if group-level data were normal distributed.
The probability that childrens' median response times to object-relative clauses were normal distributed was p = 1.5%.
The probability that childrens' median response times to subject-relative clauses were normal distributed was p = 27.0%.
The probability that adults' median response times to object-relative clauses were normal distributed was p = 2.1%.
The probability that adults' median response times to subject-relative clauses were normal distributed was p = 2.4%.


3.1.2 Response accuracy

For the analysis of variance (ANOVA), all data must be normal distributed with equal variance.
A Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted to determine if group-level accuracy data were normal distributed.
The probability that childrens' response accuracy data to object-relative clauses were normal distributed was p = 6.5%.
The probability that childrens' response accuracy data to subject-relative clauses were normal distributed was p = 2.0%.
The probability that adults' response accuracy data to object-relative clauses were normal distributed was = 20.3%.
The probability that adults' response accuracy data to subject-relative clauses were normal distributed was p = 11.2%.
A Levene's test yielded that the probability that accuracy data were distributed with equal variance was less than p = 0.1%.

These tests indicate that accuracy data were a bad fit for the intented ANOVA.
To meet the requirements of the ANOVA, we transformed the accuracy data with the inverse sigmoid function x = -log(1./acc-1).
This procedure created singularities when transforming flawless performances.
Therefore, we added a single incorrect trial to every subject's performance for the following analysis.

After the transformation, the same tests as before were conducted.
The probability that childrens' response accuracy data to object-relative clauses were normal distributed was p = 27.3%.
The probability that childrens' response accuracy data to subject-relative clauses were normal distributed was p = 25.3%.
The probability that adults' response accuracy data to object-relative clauses were normal distributed was = 3.6%.
The probability that adults' response accuracy data to subject-relative clauses were normal distributed was p = 0.5%.
The probability that accuracy data were distributed with equal variance was p = 72.2%.


3.1.3 Analysis of combined performance data

The ANOVA was conducted with the transformed accuracy data and the median response time.
Each subject provided one data point for each metric.
Data were analyzed with a group x condition design.
Accuracy estimates were transformed back with the sigmoid function acc = 1/(1+exp(-x)).

Children responded 0.39s slower than adults (1.94s vs. 1.55s).
This difference was significant (F_56 = 9.4, p = 0.3%).

Children responded with an average accuracy of 93.8% (92.2%, 95.0%).
Adults performed much better, with an average accuracy of 97.9% (97.5%, 98.3%).
This difference was highly significant (F_56 = 52, p = 1.6e-9).

Sentence condition had no impact on median response times (F = 0.33, p = 57%) or on response accuracy (F = 1.3, p = 26%).
There was no interaction effect between group and sentence condition (F < 0.1, p > 80%).
