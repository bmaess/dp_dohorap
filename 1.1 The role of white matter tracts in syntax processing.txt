1.1 The role of white matter tracts in syntax processing

[White fiber tracts]
Brain tries to save space and energy
Connections cost both space and energy, so brain is largely locally organized
Long-distance connections cost much more space and energy than local connections, while not transferring more information
The fact that long-distance connections exist means the transferred information is especially important and/or highly compressed

Dorsal & Ventral streams
The ventral stream uses two major long-distance fiber tracts: ECFS and UF
Ventral pathway I (ECFS): STG to BA45
Ventral pathway II (UF): aSTG to FOP
The dorsal stream uses two major long-distance fiber tracts: The arcuate fascicle and the superior longitudinal fascicle.
Dorsal pathway I (SLF): pSTG to premotor cortex in BA6
Dorsal pathway II (AF): pSTG to BA44
