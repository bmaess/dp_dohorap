 1.1 Functional anatomy of language processing

Brain tries to save space and energy
Connections cost both space and energy, so brain is largely locally organized
Long-distance connections cost much more space and energy than local connections, while not transferring more information
The fact that long-distance connections exist means the transferred information is especially important and/or highly compressed
Dorsal & Ventral streams
The ventral stream uses two major long-distance fiber tracts: ECFS and UF
Ventral pathway I (ECFS): STG to BA45
Ventral pathway II (UF): aSTG to FOP
The dorsal stream uses two major long-distance fiber tracts: The arcuate fascicle and the superior longitudinal fascicle.
Dorsal pathway I: pSTG to premotor cortex in BA6
Dorsal pathway II: pSTG to BA44
 
 1.2 Developmental aspects
 Kids don't have the AF tract yet
 Without AF, kids rely strongly on other regions (BA45)
 Processing is slower and more vulnerable to bias
 Error rates from misunderstandings are higher too
