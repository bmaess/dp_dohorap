 1.1 Functional anatomy of language processing

[White fiber tracts]
Brain tries to save space and energy
Connections cost both space and energy, so brain is largely locally organized
Long-distance connections cost much more space and energy than local connections, while not transferring more information
The fact that long-distance connections exist means the transferred information is especially important and/or highly compressed

[Language network]
Dorsal & Ventral streams
The ventral stream uses two major long-distance fiber tracts: ECFS and UF
Ventral pathway I (ECFS): STG to BA45
Ventral pathway II (UF): aSTG to FOP
The dorsal stream uses two major long-distance fiber tracts: The arcuate fascicle and the superior longitudinal fascicle.
Dorsal pathway I (SLF): pSTG to premotor cortex in BA6
Dorsal pathway II (AF): pSTG to BA44

[Cortical activity]
Region of interest: pSTG
pSTG is involved in complex syntax
Accurate role in syntactic processing isn't clear yet
Utilizing dorsal pathway I and II for researching pSTG
Paradigm of choice: Object-/Subject-relative clauses
Previous findings: pSTG and IFG (BA44, 45, 47 + FOP) are more active in object-relative clauses


1.2 Developmental aspects

Kids don't have the AF tract yet
Previous findings: kids rely more on the ventral pathway
Ventral processing involves BA45 (no condition effect in adults)
Processing is more vulnerable to bias (semantic crosstalk)
Behavioral data is worse too


1.3 Research questions

Replication of EEG/fMRI results with MEG?
Which cortical regions are involved in the conditional effect?
Is semantic content relevant?
How long does each processing stage take?
In which order do the steps take place?
Can we see a different pathway in kids?

[Hypotheses]
Condition effect mainly in pSTG, BA44 (adults), BA45 (kids)
Kids: worse performance than adults
Kids: less involvement of pSTG
Adults vs kids: Dorsal II vs. Ventral II


1.4 Choice of measurement methods

[Acquisition]
MEG: Very high sampling rate
very little spatial distortion from the head
Low signal-to-noise ratio

[Forward models]
Based on individual high-resolution anatomical data
1-layer BEM: Robust creation, good software support
Quick and semi-automated process

[Localization]
Distributed source model: models a ton of unwanted activity
-> high SNR for actual ROI
sLORETA: no overlap effect at the boundaries, high ROI specificity

[Information transfer]
Meaning of information transfer
modelling vs. model-free, linear vs. nonlinear
Transfer Entropy is suited best for highly complex, nonlinear timescale data
Potential pitfall: Volume conduction (can also come from bad localization)
TrenTOOL can correct volume conduction
