A positive effect indicates that activity evoked by object-relative clauses was more positive than activity evoked by subject-relative clauses. In the case of gradiometers, "more positive" means a higher regional RMS. With localized data, "more positive" means a higher z-score from the sLORETA source reconstruction.


Sensor-level activity

Clusteranalysis

Comparing activity between conditions yielded several temporal clusters.

For children, significant differences were observed by right-parietal, left-temporal magnetometers and right-temporal gradiometers.
Right parietal magnetometers showed a negative effect between 159ms and 374ms (p = 3.1%).
Left temporal magnetometers showed a negative effect between 345ms and 622ms (p = 1.0%).
Right temporal gradiometers showed a positive effect between 1426ms and 1660ms (p = 4.3%).

For adults, clusters of significant differences were observed by left-temporal gradiometers and left-parietal magnetometers.
Left temporal gradiometers showed a positive effect between 257ms and 454ms (p = 2.0%).
Left parietal magnetometers showed a positive effect between 618ms and 769ms (p = 0.28%).

Comparisons of average activity

We computed average event-related fields (ERF) for each subject and sensor region.
Activity from these ERF was selected with two different types of time windows.

First, ERF activity was compared by using the time windows of region-specific clusters.
In children, the first (159ms-374ms) and the second (345ms-622ms) time window yielded effects.
The positive effect during the first time window was captured by the right parietal magnetometers (p = 3.1%, F = 5.3).
A negative effect during the second timewindow was mainly captured by the left frontal magnetometers (p = 4.5%, F = 4.5).
This effect was also (weakly) captured by the left temporal magnetometers (p = 9.1%, F = 3.1).
The weak effect from the right temporal magnetometers pointed in the opposite direction (p = 7.2%, F = 3.6).
In adults, only the second time window (618ms-769ms) yielded an effect.
This positive effect was weakly captured by the left temporal gradiometers (p = 5.2%, F = 4.0).

Second, ERF activity was compared blindly between 0 and 1200ms after onset in 100ms intervals from all regions.
The comparisons across these time windows yielded no effects in adults, and two positive effects in children.
Both effects occurred between 400ms and 500ms after onset.
One effect was captured the by right frontal gradiometer group.
It indicated that activity was slightly stronger during object-related clauses (p = 6.1%, t = 4.48).
The other effect was captured by the right temporal magnetometer group.
It indicated that evoked fields were slightly more positive during object-related clauses (p = 3.4%, t = 4.84).
These statistical results were Bonferroni-corrected with 66 comparisons (2 hemispheres, 3 sensory regions, 11 time intervals).
