A positive effect indicates that activity evoked by object-relative clauses was more positive than activity evoked by subject-relative clauses. In the case of gradiometers, "more positive" means a higher regional RMS. With localized data, "more positive" means a higher z-score from the sLORETA source reconstruction.


Sensor-level activity

Clusteranalysis

Comparing activity between conditions yielded several temporal clusters.

For children, significant differences were observed by right-parietal, left-temporal magnetometers and right-temporal gradiometers.
Right parietal magnetometers showed a negative effect between 159ms and 374ms (p = 3.1%).
Left temporal magnetometers showed a negative effect between 345ms and 622ms (p = 1.0%).
Right temporal gradiometers showed a positive effect between 1426ms and 1660ms (p = 4.3%).

For adults, clusters of significant differences were observed by left-temporal gradiometers and left-parietal magnetometers.
Left temporal gradiometers showed a positive effect between 257ms and 454ms (p = 2.0%).
Left parietal magnetometers showed a positive effect between 618ms and 769ms (p = 0.28%).

Average data

We computed average event-related fields (ERF) for each subject and sensor region.

We compared ERF activity blindly between 0 and 1200ms after onset in 100ms intervals from all regions.
The comparisons across these time windows yielded no effects in adults, and two positive effects in children.
Both effects occurred between 400ms and 500ms after onset.
One effect was captured the by right frontal gradiometer group.
It indicated that activity was slightly stronger during object-related clauses (p = 6.1%, t = 4.48).
The other effect was captured by the right temporal magnetometer group.
It indicated that evoked fields were slightly more positive during object-related clauses (p = 3.4%, t = 4.84).
These statistical results were Bonferroni-corrected with 66 comparisons (2 hemispheres, 3 sensory regions, 11 time intervals).


Source-level activity

We estimated cortical activity with sLORETA localization on a subject-specific BEM model.
The localized activity was acquired with two different strategies: pooled (higher values represent stronger activity) and signed (higher values represent stronger activity, but currect direction with respect to the cortex outer normal is preserved).
This activity was compared within 7 anatomically defined cortical regions: PAC, pSTS, aSTG, BA44, BA45, BA6v

First, localized activity was compared by using the time windows from the cluster analysis.
Comparisons in children only yielded an effect during the third time window (1426ms-1660ms).
This positive effect was represented in signed activity from the left precentral sulcus (p=4.7%, F=4.4).
Comparisons in adults only yielded an effect during the second time window (618ms-769ms).
This positive effect could be observed in pooled activity from the right pSTS (p=3.8%, F=4.6).
It also appeared in signed activity from the left BA45 (p=4.5%, F=4.3) and the right PAC (p=4.4%, F=4.4).

Second, localized activity was compared in 4 cortical regions between 0 and 2500ms after onset in 100ms intervals.
These statistical results were FDR-corrected with 25 comparisons.
