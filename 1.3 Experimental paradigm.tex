\section{Experimental paradigm}

Task: Exploring role and timing of pSTG/pSTS activity in complex syntax processing
Actor/Undergoer setup
Object-/Subject-relative clauses

Sentences are comparable to Constable, 2004:
Subject/object-relative clauses
"'The biologist - who showed the video - studied the snake."'
"'The biologist - who the video showed - studied the snake."'
fMRI effect in:
Left: BA40, 44/45, 39, premotor cortex
Right: BA44/45, premotor cortex

Also comparable to Bornkessel, 2006:
specifically, cases E and F (unambiguous subject- and object-relative clauses with active verb)
significant fMRI effect in:
left: IFG (pars opercularis), pSTG, pSTS, inferior frontal junction, ventral premotor cortex, interparietal sulcus
right: interparietal sulcus

Repeated-measures design
Stationarity assumption
