\section{Research questions}

\subsection{Expected discoveries}
Replication of EEG/fMRI results with MEG?
Which cortical regions are involved in the conditional effect?
Is semantic content relevant?
How long does each processing stage take?
In which order do the steps take place?
Can we see a different pathway in kids?

\subsection{Hypotheses}
Condition effect mainly in pSTG, BA44 (adults), BA45 (kids)
Kids: worse performance than adults
Kids: less involvement of pSTG
Adults vs kids: Dorsal II vs. Ventral II
