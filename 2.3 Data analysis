2.3.1 Behavioral data

Two types of behavioral data were analyzed for group and condition effects: response time (RT) and response accuracy (RA). Response time was measured at the condition onset, i.e. at the "d" sound of "den" or "der" (in the subject-relative clause or the object-relative clause, respectively). First, the slowest 10% of all trials were omitted. Of the remaining 90%, trials were omitted when they contained an incorrect response to the task or were skipped by the user. The median RT and the average RA were calculated per subject. Since both metrics failed to adhere to a normal distribution once combined across groups or conditions, they were compared with a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Within-group comparisons were performed with [an ANOVA].

2.3.2 Sensor-space activity

[Preprocessing and HPI correction]
Data were preprocessed with the Elekta NeuromagÂ® MaxFilter package (version 2.2, May 2009), with Matlab (version 2014a) and with MNE-Python (version 0.8.6, October 2014). MaxFilter software reduces noise in the data by suppressing magnetic interference coming from outside and inside the sensory array, using signal-space separation (SSS). MEG recordings were corrected for HPI movements, and co-registered across blocks to the inital head position for each individual. Data were then subjected to a 0.4 FIR highpass filter (Hamming window design, 4367 coefficients, -130db damping at 0Hz) to remove DC components.

[Artifact removal]
MEG channels with abnormally high noise levels as identified by visual inspection were rejected from further analysis. A maximum of [3 channels] (median: [1 channel]) was removed.
The resulting pre-processed data contained major artifacts from spontaneous channel jumps, electrocardiographic (ECG) activity and electrooculographic (EOG) activity. Jump amplitudes were detected by selecting peaks in the z-transformed continuous data that exceeded a threshold of 12 standard deviations. Segments of 2 seconds in the pre-processed continuous data were rejected if any magnitude channel exceeded an amplitude of 6 * 10e-12 T (gradiometer channels: 400 * 10e-12 T/m). Continuous data were then decomposed into independent components (ICA) that explained 99% of the variance. Components that correlated significantly more (threshold of z=0.4) with EOG or ECG channels than other components were removed (children: median of 1 component per block, maximum of 3; adults: median of 0 components per block, maximum of 2). The resulting ICA components were used to reconstruct continuous data.

[Epoching]
The main trigger was set at the condition onset (described in [2.3.1]). Epochs were created between 1000ms before and 3000ms after the main trigger. If the trial was skipped or answered incorrectly, the epoch was rejected. This procedure yielded an average of [] trials in children and [] trials in adults. Data were filtered before epoching with a 45Hz FIR highpass ([filter order 6, cutoff at 50Hz]). Due to the highpass filtering, no baseline correction was applied.
