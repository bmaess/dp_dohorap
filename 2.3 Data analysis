2.3.1 Behavioral data

Data were preprocessed with the three software packages: Elekta NeuromagÂ® MaxFilter (version 2.2), Matlab (version 2014a) and MNE-Python (version 0.8.6).
Two types of behavioral data were analyzed for group and condition effects: response time (RT) and response accuracy (RA).
Response time was measured at the condition onset, i.e. at the "d" sound of "den" or "der" (in the subject-relative clause or the object-relative clause, respectively).
Trials were omitted when they contained an incorrect response to the task or were skipped by the user.
RT and RA were determined for each subject separately from the remaining trials.
Median of the RT
Both metrics were tested for the requirements for an analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Normality of the residuals was tested with a Shapiro-Wilk test [SW], implemented in Matlab.
Equality of variances was tested with a Levene [LEV] test, implemented in SPSS.

2.3.2.1 Preprocessing and artifact correction

[Preprocessing and HPI correction]
MaxFilter was used to reduced noise in the data by suppressing magnetic interference coming from outside and inside the sensory array, using signal-space separation (SSS).
MEG recordings were corrected for HPI movements, and co-registered across blocks to the inital head position for each individual.
Data were then subjected to a 0.4Hz FIR highpass filter (Hamming window design, 4367 coefficients, -130db damping at 0Hz, processing in Matlab) to remove slow trends.

[Artifact removal]
MEG channels with abnormally high noise levels as identified by visual inspection were rejected from further analysis. A median of [1 channel] (maximum: [3 channels]) was removed.
The resulting pre-processed data contained major artifacts from spontaneous channel jumps, electrocardiographic (ECG) activity and electrooculographic (EOG) activity.
Jump amplitudes were detected by selecting peaks in the z-transformed continuous data that exceeded a threshold of 12 standard deviations.
Segments of 2 seconds in the pre-processed continuous data were rejected if any magnitude channel exceeded an amplitude of 6 * 10e-12 T (gradiometer channels: 400 * 10e-12 T/m).
Continuous data were then decomposed into independent components (ICA) that explained 99% of the variance.
Components that correlated with EOG or ECG channels were removed with the MNE methods preprocessing.ica_find_ecg_events() and preprocessing.ica_find_eog_events(), respectively. ICA-based correction removed a median of [1 component] per block (maximum: 3) in children, and a median of [0 components] per block (maximum: 1) in adults.
The resulting ICA components were used to reconstruct continuous data.

[Epoching]
The main trigger was set at the condition onset (described in [2.3.1]).
Epochs were created between 1000ms before and 3000ms after the main trigger.
If the trial was skipped or answered incorrectly, the epoch was rejected.
This procedure yielded an average of [] trials in children and [] trials in adults.
Data were filtered before epoching with a 45Hz FIR lowpass ([insert filter properties from mne-python]).
A baseline correction was omitted in favor of the initial highpass filtering.

2.3.2.2 Time window estimation

The condition effect was used to determine suitable time windows, which created a multiple comparison problem.
This problem was resolved with a cluster-level permutation test.
Extracted trials were split into a 4 parts (2 groups x 2 conditions).
Since the group had a strong impact on RT (see [3.1.1]), effective time windows were estimated separately for children and adults.
All trials within each subject group were pooled for this step.
Trials contained average data from four different general locations and two conditions.
The sensor selection was determined by the MNE function read_selection.
General locations were specified according to [table 2].
Clusters were determined with the MNE function stats.permutation_cluster_test (see [8]).
This used 2500 permutations, an F-threshold of 1.0, and a one-tailed test.
