\paragraph{What do this data mean?}
Sensor data:

Source data:

Interaction analysis:

- epilepsy study shows bias towards short feedforward and long feedback propagation

\paragraph{Are the hypotheses confirmed?}

\paragraph{What have similar studies found out?}

\paragraph{In which ways is my study limited, and what can it dare to say?}
