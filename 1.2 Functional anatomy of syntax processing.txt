1.2 Functional anatomy of syntax processing

Region of interest: pSTS
pSTG is involved in complex syntax
Adults:
"Neuroimaging studies have tried to characterise the neu- ral substrate for representing human action. Many of these studies have followed a different tradition in psychophysics and developmental psychology of investigating the percep- tion of “biological motion” – that is, the characteristic articu- lated motion of chordate animal bodies (e.g. Vaina, Solomon, Chowdhury, Sinha, & Belliveau, 2001; Grossman & Blake, 2002; Beauchamp, Lee, Haxby, & Martin, 2002; Pelphrey, Mitchell, McKeown, Goldstein, Allison, & McCarthy, 2003) or body and face parts (e.g. Hoffman & Haxby, 2000; Hooker et al. 2003; Kilts et al. 2003; Pelphrey et al., 2003). Biologi- cal motion can also be perceived from the relative motion of just a few dots (“point-light walkers”, Johansson, 1973); if the dots are spatially or temporally rearranged, the percept is destroyed. These neuroimaging studies suggest that one brain region, the posterior superior temporal sulcus, is par- ticularly involved in the representation of biological motion.
Two sets of recent neuroimaging data suggest that the role of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) may extend beyond a response to biological motion, to more ab- stract representations of intentional action. First, Castelli, Happe, Frith, & Frith, (2000) and Schultz, Grelotti, Klin, Kleinman, Van der Gaag, Marois, & Skudlarski, (2003) reported that a region of the pSTS showed a significantly higher response to animations of moving geometric shapes that depicted complex social interactions than to anima- tions depicting inanimate motion. Second, using movies of human actors engaged in structured goal-directed ac- tions (e.g. cleaning the kitchen), Zacks, Braver, Sheridan, Donaldson, Snyder, Ollinger, Buckner, & Raichle, (2001) found that activity in the pSTS was enhanced when the agent switched from one action to another, suggesting that this region encodes the goal-structure of actions. Both of these results are consistent with a role for a region of pSTS cor- tex in representing intentional action, and not just biological motion." (doi:10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.04.015)


"hierarchy construction might be supported by left inferior frontal (particularly BA44/45) and posterior superior temporal regions: (Ben-Shachar et al., 2003, 2004; Caplan et al., 2002; Just et al., 1996; Röder et al., 2002; Stromswold et al., 1996)"

"the enhanced inferior frontal (BA 44/45) activation observed for these sentence types is engendered by highly specialized aspects of syntactic processing, namely by syntactic transformations (Ben-Shachar et al., 2003, 2004; Grodzinsky, 2000)."

 "More complex  syntactic processing, 
 including  the  identification  of  hierarchical  structures  within  a  sentence,  takes 
 place  later  at  around  300ms  to  500ms  in  the  already  mentioned  pSTG/STS 
 (Cooke  et  al.,  2002;  Vandenberghe  et  al.,  2002;  Humphries  et  al.,  2005; 
 Bornkessel and Schlesewsky, 2006; Kinno et al., 2008; Friederici et al., 2009; 
 Snijders et al., 2009; Santi and Grodzinsky, 2010; Newman et al., 2010). How-
 ever,  this  is  not  achieved  by  the  pSTG/STS  alone  but,  as  Friederici  argues, 
 critically involves the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFGoper) in 
 Broca’s  area  (Friederici  et  al.,  2006;  Makuuchi  et  al.,  2009;  Newman  et  al., 
 2010;  Wilson  et  al.,  2010)." (Skeide 2013)

Children:
- Development of simple sentence processing is complete at age 3 (Friederici 2005)
- Kids often don't have the AF tract yet until early adulthood
Previous findings: kids rely more on the ventral pathway
Ventral processing involves BA45 (no condition effect in adults)
Processing is more vulnerable to bias (semantic crosstalk)
