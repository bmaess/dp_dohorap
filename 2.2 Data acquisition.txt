2.2.1 MEG

[import scanning blurb from the wiki]
Acquisition of magnetoencephalographic data is widely performed in a similar manner. The study by [1], if not stated otherwise, will be quoted as a typical example in this chapter.

[MEG scanner and data acquisition]
MEG data were collected with an Elekta Neuromag VectorView® MEG scanner at the Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity (OHBA), Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital, Oxford, U.K. The scanner comprises 306 MEG-channel sensors (102 magnetometers, 204 planar gradiometers). Sensors were tuned prior to each MEG recording session to limit noise levels to approximately 2.5 fT/cm. Sensors that became very noisy during a recording block would be individually re-tuned at the next inter-block break, using the Neuromag automatized heating process or by eye, as necessary. Continuous MEG data were recorded at 1000 Hz sampling rate (0.3–330 Hz bandpass filter). Prior to data acquisition, all metal and other potential sources of electromagnetic interference were removed from participants. Quality of recording was confirmed by visual inspection of 1–2 min of MEG recording during quiet sitting prior to the start of the experiment. Electro-oculogram (EOG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) time-series were recorded simultaneously with MEG to track potential noise sources and artifacts. Four head position indicator (HPI) coils were attached to the participant's head and a Polhemus stylus and digitizer device were used to record the locations of fiducial points (right and left pre-auricular points (RPA, LPA) and nasion), the HPI coils, and between 40 and 80 extra digitizer points on the head surface. Prior to the recording of each stimulus block, head location in the scanner was measured with an automatic process that detected the coils. Continuous HPI recorded any head movements during data acquisition.

Compared to this example, there were a few minor differences in this study: The scanner for this study was located in Bennewitz, at the department of Magnetoencephalography, Institute for cognitive and brain sciences, Leipzig, Germany. The quality of recording was determined each session in an empty room. We used five HPI coils, attached to the forehead. Finally, we used between 180 and 200 extra digitizer points on the head surface.

[Preprocessing and HPI correction]
[quote start]
Data were preprocessed with Elekta Neuromag® MaxFilter software (version 2.1, May 2009). MaxFilter software reduces noise in the data by suppressing magnetic interference coming from outside and inside the sensory array, using signal-space separation (SSS). The MaxMove sub-command was used to spatially co-register MEG recordings across blocks to the median head position for each individual. MaxMove continuous HPI movement compensation was also applied.

Our block-level recordings were coregistered to the initial (instead of the median) head position. Data were then subjected to a 0.4–45Hz bandpass filter to remove DC components and influences from 50Hz power lines. [insert filter properties]

[Artifact removal]
MEG channels with abnormally high noise levels as identified by visual inspection were rejected from further analysis.

A maximum of two such channels was removed per participant and scan. Eye-related artifacts such as blinks were identified as deviations in the EOG recording trace. Epochs containing artifacts arising from the eyes or intermittent sensor noise were removed from further analysis. Peak-to-peak threshold for removal of eye blinks and overt eye movements was within the range 100–200 × 10−6 V. Maximum noise level threshold for magnetometer and gradiometer activity was within range 2–3 × 10−12 T and 1.5–2 × 10−10 T/m, respectively. In both cases, the specific threshold depended on the artifact amplitudes recorded for each individual. After artifact removal, in all cases there remained at least 95 trials per stimulus per participant.
