Preliminary analysis:
- Freesurfer-based surface extraction and detailed brain segmentation
- estimate anisotropy properties from DWI data
	- Fit diffusion tensors into DWI data
	- Select only white matter voxels
	- Convert diffusion tensors into conductivity tensors

Segmentation:
- SPM-based 5-tissue segmentation of the combined T1 and T2 dataset
- Assemble a voxel-based head model from tissue probability maps
- Increase cortical thickness to satisfy Venant condition
- Convert voxel model to mesh
- Close diagonal voxel leaks
- Insert dipole locations from Freesurfer
- Insert anisotropic conductivity properties
- Save in Vista format
