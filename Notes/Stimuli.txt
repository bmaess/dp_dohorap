Pictures:
- 5 animals (monkey, fox, dog, wolf, lion)
- 6 activities (catch, comb, paint, push, scrub, pull)
Sentences:
- 114 unique sentences
- 154 speech variations (average of 1.35 variations per sentence, max 3)
Structure:
- 19 trials per cluster
- visual feedback after each cluster
	- speed/accuracy tradeoff: balancing strongly towards accuracy
- 8 clusters per block
- 2 blocks per session

Tutorial:
- Visual description of the remote control
- First task: like subsequent task, just with added written instructions and question
- Broken task: like subsequent task, just with ambiguous sentence ("Wo ist der Affe, den den Löwe fängt?")
- Subsequent tasks: like full task, just with two explicit animal descriptors ("Wo ist der Affe, den der Löwe fängt?")
- stops automatically when subject is good enough
	- either when error percentage drops under 20%, with an average response time of less then 3000ms
	- or when error percentage drops under 12%

Full task:
- two side-by-side white images on black background
	- two cartoon animals interacts with each other on each image
	- images are identical, except that the roles are reversed (recipient becomes agent and vice versa)
- 10ms delay
- spoken question starts playing
	- only one explicit animal descriptor ("Wo ist das Tier, das der Löwe fängt?")
	- questions are phonetically and syntactically identical until "das der"
- auditory and visual feedback after the response
	- Windows XP "Device plugged in" and "Device removed" sounds for correct and incorrect feedback (respectively)
	- Green checkmark and diagonal red cross displayed on the response side, underneath the image
- pause of 400-800ms (with visual feedback still visible)
- next trial
