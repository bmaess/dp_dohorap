- Gluing 5 HPI coils 4 EOG electrodes (2 vertical at the left eye, 2 horizontal) to the face
- Localizing HPI coils and head shape with a digitizer
- Entering the MEG, laying down, inserting earplugs, familiarizing with the remote control
- Running the hearing threshold test:
	- Spoken word ("Affe") is repeated with increasing loudness
	- Subject presses a button as soon as they hear the word
	- repeated 3x for each ear
- Entering the hearing threshold into the main experiment
- Running the tutorial
- Running the first experimental block
- short break: sitting or standing up, getting a drink, 3-5min
- Running the second experimental block
- Removing the electrodes
