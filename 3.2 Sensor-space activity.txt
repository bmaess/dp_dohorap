Temporal clusters

Comparing activity between conditions yielded several temporal clusters.

For children, significant differences were observed by right-parietal, left-temporal magnetometers and right-temporal gradiometers.
Right temporal gradiometers showed an effect between 1426ms and 1660ms (p = 4.3%).
Left temporal magnetometers showed an effect between 345ms and 622ms (p = 1.0%).
Right parietal magnetometers showed an effect between 159ms and 374ms (p = 3.1%).

For adults, clusters of significant differences were observed by left-temporal gradiometers and left-parietal magnetometers.
Left temporal gradiometers showed an effect between 257ms and 454ms (p = 2.0%).
Left parietal magnetometers showed an effect between 618ms and 769ms (p = 0.28%).


Sensor-level activity

We computed average event-related fields (ERF) for each subject and sensor region.
Activity from these ERF was selected with two different types of time windows.

First, ERF activity was compared by using the time windows of region-specific clusters.
In children, the second (345ms-622ms) and the first time window (159ms-374ms) yielded an effect.
The effect during the second timewindow was mainly captured by the left frontal magnetometers (p = 4.5%, F = 4.5).
It was weakly captured by the left (p = 9.1%, F = 3.1) and right (p = 7.2%, F = 3.6) temporal magnetometers.
The effect during the third time window was captured by the right parietal magnetometers (p = 3.1%, F = 5.3).
In adults, only the second time window (618ms-769ms) yielded an effect.
This effect was weakly captured by the left temporal gradiometers (p = 5.2%, F = 4.0).

Second, ERF activity was compared blindly between 0 and 1200ms after onset in 100ms intervals from all regions.
The comparisons across these time windows yielded no effects in adults, and two effects in children.
Both effects occurred between 400ms and 500ms after onset.
One effect was captured the by right frontal gradiometer group.
It indicated that activity was slightly stronger during object-related clauses (p = 6.1%, t = 4.48).
The other effect was captured by the right temporal magnetometer group.
It indicated that evoked fields were slightly more positive during object-related clauses (p = 3.4%, t = 4.84).
All statistical results were Bonferroni-corrected with 66 comparisons (2 hemispheres, 3 sensory regions, 11 time intervals).


Source-level activity
We estimated cortical activity with sLORETA localization on a subject-specific BEM model.
This activity was compared in different cortical regions.
First, localized activity was compared by using the time windows from the cluster analysis.
Comparisons in children only yielded an effect during the first time window (1426ms-1660ms).
This effect was represented in signed activity from the left prcs (p=4.7%, F=4.4).
It was also weakly represented in pooled activity from the right BA44 (p = 5.9%, F = 4.0).
Comparisons in adults only yielded an effect during the second time window (618ms-769ms).
It could be seen in pooled activity from the right pSTS (p=3.8%, F=4.6).
This effect was also visible in signed activity from the left BA45 (p=4.5%, F=4.3) and the right PAC (p=4.4%, F=4.4).

Second, localized activity was compared blindly between 0 and 1600ms after onset in 200ms intervals.
In this comparison, only adults showed an effect.
The first effect could be observed in the left region BA45.
Between 400ms and 600ms, activity was more positive during object-related clauses (p = 1.7%, t = 4.5).
This effect continued in this region between 600ms and 800ms (p = 1.5%, t = 4.6).
During this time interval, the effect in the right region pSTS showed the same direction (p = 0.93%, t = 4.8).

All statistical results were Bonferroni-corrected with 56 comparisons (2 hemispheres, 4 localized regions, 7 time intervals).
