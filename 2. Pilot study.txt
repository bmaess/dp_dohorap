[Analysis]

Behavioral data was analyzed with Matlab (version 2014a).
Two types of behavioral data were analyzed for group and condition effects: response time (RT) and response accuracy (RA).
Response time was measured at the condition onset, i.e. at the "d" sound of "den" or "der" (in the subject-relative clause or the object-relative clause, respectively).
Trials were omitted when the subject skipped or answered them incorrectly.
Subject-specific response accuracy was evaluated against the chance level
Response times from remaining trials
