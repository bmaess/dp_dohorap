21 children, behavioral experiment
Two pictures, spoken sentence ("Wo ist der Hund, den der Tiger w√§scht?"), two buttons
Object-relative clauses appeared 2.5 times as often as subject-relative clauses.

[Analysis]

Behavioral data were analyzed with Matlab (version 2014a).
Response accuracy was evaluated for the case that subjects responded randomly.
For this purpose, accuracy was compared to the outcome of a random sequence of binary events.
We established the alpha = 0.01 confidence interval for the percentage of correct trials (k/n) that could be answered correctly purely by chance.
This calculation was implemented using the binomial fit method in Matlab: binofit(k, n, alpha).
If the upper confidence interval of this calculation exceeded the subject-specific accuracy, the subject was removed from further analysis.
Two subjects failed to exceed chance level performance, leaving 19 subjects for the analysis.

Two types of behavioral data were analyzed for group and condition effects: response time (RT) and response accuracy (RA).
Response time was measured at the condition onset, i.e. at the "d" sound of "den" or "der" (in the subject-relative clause or the object-relative clause, respectively).
Trials were omitted when the subject skipped or answered them incorrectly, or responded earlier than the cue.
Accuracy was calculated by dividing the amount of of correct trials by the amount of total trials for each subject.

The Shapiro-Wilk test (Matlab method swtest()) was used to test for normal-distributed residuals.
Accuracy passed this test at a p = 0.01 significance level.
The impact of the syntactic condition on response accuracy was determined with a T-test.

Response times were transformed with the logarithm function to approach normality.
Residuals did not pass the Shapiro-Wilk test, but appeared to be close to a normal distribution (see Fig. 2.1).
The impact on response time was determined with a five-way-ANOVA (main effects only).
ANOVA are robust against small deviations from normality, which allowed us to assume normality for this test.
The five possible impact factors were response side (left / right), condition (object-relative / subject-relative) and three sentence particles.
The sentence particles comprised the race of the actor and recipient and the performed action.
Performed actions included painting, pushing, combing, washing, pulling and catching.
The actor and recipient could appear as two of 12 different races: Lion, rabbit, wolf, bird, fox, hedgehog, dog, tiger, ape, ladybug, bear and frog.
No two races appeared in the same picture.

[Results]

Subjects responded after a median delay of 2.0s (quickest 5%: 1.0s, slowest 5%: 5.2s).
The median accuracy was 70% (worst 5%: 62%, best 5%: 94%).
The syntactic condition had a highly significant effect on accuracy (p < 0.001, t(18) = -14.0).
The syntactic condition also had a highly significant effect on response time (p < 0.001, F = 17.0).
No other factors had a significant effect on response time (p > 0.1, F < 1.5).
Post-hoc tests were conducted to reveal the condition-specific average data values.
The average accuracy for responses to subject-relative clauses was much higher than to object-relative clauses (93% and 64%, respectively).
The median response time to subject-relative clauses was slightly higher than to object-relative clauses (2.1s and 1.8s).

We repeated the binomial fit test while selecting only the accuracy for object-relative clauses.
8 of 19 subjects failed the test in this condition at a p = 0.01 significance level.
After removing these subjects from the analysis, selected tests were repeated.
The impact of the syntactic condition on response time weakened slightly (p < 0.001, F = 14.3).
Median response times remained stable for both conditions.
The difference in accuracy weakened as well (p < 0.001, t(10) = -9.4).
Average accuracy in the remaining subjects improved slightly (95% for subject-relative clauses and 68% for object-relative clauses).
