Data were preprocessed with the three software packages: Elekta NeuromagÂ® MaxFilter (version 2.2), Matlab (version 2014a) and MNE-Python (version 0.8.6).

3.3.1 Behavioral data

Two types of behavioral data were analyzed for group and condition effects: response time (RT) and response accuracy (RA).
Response time was measured at the condition onset, i.e. at the "d" sound of "den" or "der" (in the subject-relative clause or the object-relative clause, respectively).
Trials were omitted when the subject skipped or answered them incorrectly.
Trials were also omitted if the response took longer than 4000ms.
This procedure removed 11.1% of the childrens' trials, and 2.5% of the adults' trials.
RT and RA were determined for each subject separately from the remaining trials.
Both metrics were tested for the requirements for an analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Normality of the residuals was tested with a Shapiro-Wilk test {swtest}, implemented in Matlab.
Equality of variances was tested with a Levene {levtest} test, implemented in SPSS.
RA data failed the normality test.
To include RA data in the following analysis, they were temporarily transformed to fit a normal distribution.
This transformation was accomplished with the inverted sigmoid function:
accuracy_transformed = -log(1./accuracy-1)


3.3.2 Sensor-space activity

3.3.2.1 Preprocessing and artifact correction

[Preprocessing and HPI correction]
MaxFilter was used to reduced noise in the data by suppressing magnetic interference coming from outside and inside the sensory array, using signal-space separation (SSS).
MEG recordings were corrected for HPI movements, and co-registered across blocks to the inital head position for each individual.
Data were then subjected to a 0.4Hz FIR highpass filter (Hamming window design, 4367 coefficients, -130db damping at 0Hz, processing in Matlab) to remove slow trends.

[Artifact removal]
MEG channels with abnormally high noise levels as identified by visual inspection were rejected from further analysis. A median of [1 channel] (maximum: [3 channels]) was removed.
The resulting pre-processed data contained major artifacts from spontaneous channel jumps, electrocardiographic (ECG) activity and electrooculographic (EOG) activity.
Jump amplitudes were detected by selecting peaks in the z-transformed continuous data that exceeded a threshold of 12 standard deviations.
Segments of 2 seconds in the pre-processed continuous data were rejected if any magnitude channel exceeded an amplitude of 6 * 10e-12 T (gradiometer channels: 400 * 10e-12 T/m).
Continuous data were then decomposed into independent components (ICA) that explained 99% of the variance.
Components that correlated with EOG or ECG channels were removed with the MNE methods preprocessing.ica_find_ecg_events() and preprocessing.ica_find_eog_events(), respectively.
ICA-based correction removed an average of 2.1 components per subject and block (minimum: 1, maximum: 4).
The resulting ICA components were used to reconstruct continuous data.

[Epoching]
The main trigger was set at the condition onset (described in [2.3.1]).
Epochs were created between 1000ms before and 4000ms after the main trigger.
The epoch was rejected if the trial was skipped, or answered too slow (more than 4000ms) or answered incorrectly.
This procedure yielded an average of [] trials in children and [] trials in adults.
Data were filtered before epoching with a 45Hz FIR lowpass ([insert filter properties from mne-python]).
A baseline correction was omitted in favor of the initial highpass filtering.

3.3.2.2 Establishing time windows of interest

The condition effect was used to determine suitable time windows.
This comparison typically overestimates a multiple comparison problem.
This problem was resolved with a cluster-level permutation.
Extracted trials were split into a 4 parts (2 groups x 2 conditions).
Since the group had a strong impact on RT (see [3.1.1]), effective time windows were estimated separately for children and adults.
Trials from each of the four parts were pooled for this step.
Trials contained average data from four different sensor groups.
The sensor group selection was determined by the MNE function read_selection.
General locations were specified according to [table 2].
Clusters were determined with the MNE function stats.permutation_cluster_test (see [8]).
This process provides a less restrictive approach to multiple-comparison correction than, for example, the Bonferroni correction.
The function was run with 2500 permutations, and an t-threshold of 1.0.

3.3.3 Source space activity

[Anatomical preprocessing]
Cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation was performed with the Freesurfer image analysis suite, which is documented and freely available for download online (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/).
The technical details of these procedures are described in prior publications (Dale et al., 1999; Dale and Sereno, 1993; Fischl and Dale, 2000; Fischl et al., 2001; Fischl et al., 2002; Fischl et al., 2004a; Fischl et al., 1999a; Fischl et al., 1999b; Fischl et al., 2004b; Han et al., 2006; Jovicich et al., 2006; Segonne et al., 2004, Reuter et al. 2010, Reuter et al. 2012).
We followed the recommended processing pipeline ("recon-all"), with three optional functions.
First, the option "-nuintensitycor-3T" improved brain segmentation accuracy by optimizing the bias field correction [3.3.nuintensity].
Second, by invoking "-notal-check", we skipped the Talairach registration checks.
Talairach registration was prone to failure especially in the infant subjects, and uneccessary for our further processing steps.
Third, we supplied and included T2-weighted MRI datasets with the options "-T2" and "-T2pial".
The combination of T1- and T2-weighted images improves tissue differentiation especially around the pia mater, yielding a more accurate cortex segmentation.

[Forward model]
Our forward models consisted of one BEM layer and the MEG sensors.
Each model was constructed semi-automatically using MNE.

The finished BEM layer comprised 5140 sources.
